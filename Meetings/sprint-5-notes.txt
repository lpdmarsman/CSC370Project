Ternary Logic - Alex
 - delete guilds and player guild id be null

 - make new table for battle royale event (maybe? check logic) 
   - set current location to null when player dies
   - use coalesce to find the alive player with highest kill count




Constraints - Howie
 - drop rates between 0 and 1
 - constraint amt attribute in player_attributes to between 0 and 100
   - if amt is 0, delete

Triggers - Claire 
 - use triggers to verify status
sql trigger
create trigger char_offline 
after update on players
on each row
update players set status = "inactive"
   where New.isOnline = false;
 - trigger default values on insert based on guild role
