Ternary Logic - Alex
 - delete guilds and player guild id be null

 - make new table for battle royale event (maybe? check logic) 
   - set current location to null when player dies
   - use coalesce to find the alive player with highest kill count


Constraints - Howie
 - drop rates between 0 and 1
 - constraint amt attribute in player_items and 100


Triggers - Claire 
 - use triggers to verify status
create trigger `char_offline`
after update on `players`
for each row
update `players` set status = "inactive"
	where New.`is_online` = false;

 - delete tuple if player_item_amount is zero
create trigger `item_dne`
after update on `player_items`
for each row
delete from `players`
	where NEW.`item_count` <= 0;
