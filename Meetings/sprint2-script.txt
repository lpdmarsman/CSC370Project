For sprint 2, we added our data to the relation tables and then updated the data to add foreign keys. This covers lvl 1 of data modelling and data analytics. We then made complex queries to show that the foreign keys were implemented correctly.

We designed our foreign keys to act appropriately based on what data is being deleted; for example, if a location is deleted, location_id in the table monster_found_in would be set to NULL, however if a monster is deleted, the data deletion cascades instead. This covers the lvl 2 data modelling and data analytics.
