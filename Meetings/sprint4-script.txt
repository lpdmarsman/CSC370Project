Current sprint coverage
sprint 4:
 - weak entity sets and subsets
   - equipment
   - bosses
   - tables + data for these
 - isolation levels 
   - live explanation
 - arguing for good quality design
 - prove minimality (?)
   - projecting functional dependencies and minimal bases
 - advanced scripts
   - "We will try to cover using triggers, ternary logic, and simplifying queries for next sprint based on what is written in the module overview. As this has yet to be covered in lecture, results may differ from plan."
 - indexing (missed from sprint 3)
 - data normalization (sprint 2)



For sprint four, weak entity sets and subsets were added to the ERD, which covers level 3 data modelling. Indexes have also been added to players and guild roles, which covers level 3 data analytics. Finally, isolation levels have been changed, which will be further explained later on — this covers the level 2 back end engineering. Explanation for the data normalization, ERD changes and minimality will also be discussed in this video, which cover level 2 data modelling. Advanced scripting was not completed this sprint as it was not covered in lecture in time to fully understand the material, which would have also covered level 3 data analytics.


For next sprint we are creating and using constraints, triggers, ternary logic, and simplifying queries, which fall under level 3 of data analytics. Constraints can be demonstrated by restricting drop rates to being between 0 and 1, not including 0 and including 1 — this covers [data analytics]. The usage of triggers can be verified by creating a trigger such that the player's status is set to "inactive" when the player is offline which also cover [data analytics]. Ternary logic can be verified by making queries that make use of a NULL value, which covers level 3 data modeling. Finally, Simplifying queries can be checked by writing a complex query that can be simplified, showing both the query before and after simplification shows level 3 data analytics.
