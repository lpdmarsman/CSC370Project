# CSC370Project
This is our repo for our CSC 370 project. The purpose of this project was to design a database of our choosing.

# Project description
The database we have designed is intended to be used for a fantasy video game. It should contain information that helps people traverse the fantasy world.
For example, it should contain the following information:
	- Monsters in the world
	- Adventurers
	- Location regarding terrain


Inside of the folder "SprintMeeting" should contain text documents describing what was done during our meetings.
